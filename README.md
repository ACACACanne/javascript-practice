JavaScript Practice Repository
Learning the basic of JavaScript
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to my JavaScript playground! This repository contains a curated set of beginner-to-intermediate JavaScript exercises designed to reinforce foundational concepts, explore syntax quirks, and build confidence in writing clean, readable code.

File Overwiew:
index.js – Main practice file containing all JavaScript examples.
.gitignore – Ensures node_modules and other unnecessary files are excluded from version control.
README.md – You're reading it! Documentation of concepts covered.
package.json & package-lock.json – Present if npm libraries are installed (e.g., nodemon for auto-reloading)
Reflection.md - Reflection of the process. 

Concepts Covered:
Console Output
Conditional Logic (if, else if, else, switch statements, ternary operator)
Variables and Scope (var, let, const)
Functions
Arrays (declaration, .push(), console output)
Type Comparison (== vs ===, typeof operator, type coercion)
Boolean Logic (Truthy vs Falsy values, boolean context in conditionals)
Loops (for, while, do-while, break, continue)

Notable Insights:
Truthy/Falsy values:
• 	Falsy: 0, "", null, undefined 
• 	Truthy: non-empty strings, arrays, objects
• 	Scope awareness:
• 	var leaks outside blocks
• 	let and const are safer for predictable behavior

Housekeeping:
node-modules is excluded via .gitignore
HTML file removed temporarily to focus on pure JS logic
document.getElementByID refernces cleared from index.js because of the use of nodenom (working locally).

Next Steps:
Modularize code into separate files (function.js, loop.js)
add DOM manipulation and event handling
